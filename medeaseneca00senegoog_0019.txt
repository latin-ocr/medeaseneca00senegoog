two authors in methods and results. Each wrote
much and easily, and each appears to have cared
mainly for effectiveness os form and to have been
willing‚ if need were, to attain this at the sacrifice
ol substance. While we have not Ovid’s tragedy‚
we have his epistle of Medea toJason (Her. 12),
from which we may infer something os his oon-
ception of the heroine. Now the resemblance bc·
tween the Medea of this epistle and the Medea ol

Seneca's tragedy is too close to be mere coinci- '

dence, and moreover there are‘ many expressions
essentially and some literally the same. It is hard
to avoid the conclusion that the Neronian author
was influenced to considerable degree by the
Augustam, and that some of the variations from
Euripides may be accounted for in this way.

In modern times the tragedy of Medea has ap·

peared in Italian and French and even in German
’ and English versions.

· Permanent theaters were long unknown at
· Rome. Oi those that were finally built the gen-
eral plan was the same. At one side oi the build-
ing was the stage, very long and narr0w‚ witha
permanent background representing the street
front of one or more houses which could stand for
whatever scene the particular play required. Im-
mediately before the stage and somewhat lower
was a large space exactly semicircular‚ filled with
scats lor the magistrates and those oi senatorial
rank3 and beyond these rose the cavea, or general
seating, in semicircular tiers The cavea would
-often accommodate many thousands oi spectators.

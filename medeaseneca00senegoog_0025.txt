this word and that a³somewhat different shade of
meaning, but in the main the mastery of Cicero,
Vergil aud Ovid gives one the key to Seneca’s ’
grammar. It was in his rhetoric that hc created
a new school. Ovid had made a beginning, but
Seneca went much further. Form became the es·
sential thing. An affectation of brevity, astrain·
ing after antithesis and epigram, cameto be the
characteristics ol his work aud that of his imita-
tors (see Quintilian's judgment, LO. 10, 1‚129).
In spite, however, of undeniable faults of style,
there is much that is good and more that is pleas-

ing, and no study of the literature oi Rome cau af· ·

ford to leave Seneca out of account.

As was remarked by Quintilian (I. 0. 10. 1, 129),

Seneca was a very prolific and versatile writer,
working in almost every department of literature.
Or the prose works there are twelve books oi
‘etiamad' iu which ethical theutes are discussed‚
mainly from the Stoic point of view; two books
de Clementia and seven de Beneytcii33 an extensive
compilation entitled Naturales Quaestioam, discuss-
ing various natural phenomena3 and124 ‘epistles'
. really moral essayS, addressed to Lucilius. There
is also a collection of short letters, indorsed as au·
thentic by St. J erome, but now regarded as coun-
terfeit, which purport to have passed between
Seneca and the apostle Paul (eight written by .
Seneca, six by Paul).

Altogether the prose writings of Seneca, count-
ing only those which are admitted to be genuine,
cover more than a thousand closely printed pages
